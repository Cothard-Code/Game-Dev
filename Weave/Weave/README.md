Project repo for the game Weave

**Game Description:**

- This game is played through one control from the player, holding down the spacebar to make the enemies move. 
- The enemies in this game are elemental energies that have a variety of magical effects.
- One is neutral, one is fiery and sets the player on fire if hit, one freezes the player on hit, and another leaves behind a trail that slows the player's movement.
- There is also a friendly heart object that falls occasionally with the enemies, restoring health to the player on collision.
- The playerâ€™s score is based on how much time they have spent holding down the spacebar, causing enemies to fall.
- As the player's score goes up, enemies begin to spawn faster and become more dangerous.
- The game can be played on five different difficulties, and records the highest scores for each difficulty.
