# Point of No Return

A colorful and tricky dungeon crawl/puzzle game

**Game Description:**

- Control your avatar with the arrow keys
- Collect the colored Gems in each level to open the exit

- Each Spirit has a magical effect;
	- Green will leave a trail behind it that slows your movement
	- Red will set the walls on fire
	- Blue will freeze water into ice that makes it harder to control your avatar
- You have 3 lives per level, and lose one if you collide with fire or a Spirit
